# Data Cleaning Challenge:

Welcome to my Data Cleaning Challenge, an engaging demonstration of my data cleaning skills using Python and Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
This challenge was taken up by me to work with raw data, addressing issues, and preparing it for analysis. 

## Overview

In this challenge, I took a raw dataset (`raw_data.csv`) and applied data cleaning techniques to enhance its quality and usability. The process was documented in a Jupyter Notebook (`data_cleaning_challenge.ipynb`) for transparency and reproducibility.

## Key Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I began by conducting an EDA to understand the dataset's structure, identifying potential issues and areas for improvement.

- **Structured Cleaning Process:** Each step of the data cleaning process is well-documented with markdown cells and comments, providing insights into my thought process.

- **Effective Use of Libraries:** Leveraging Python with Pandas I efficiently cleaned the data, addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and other anomalies.

- **Organized Workflow:** The project is structured in a way that reflects a systematic and organized approach, aligning with best practices in data analysis.

## Instructions for Review

1. **Access the Repository for raw data:**
   - [Link to Raw data](https://github.com/Vivek-S1n9h/Data-cleaning-challenge-using-Python/blob/main/raw_data.csv)

2. **Navigate the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook [(`data_cleaning_challenge.ipynb`)](https://github.com/Vivek-S1n9h/Data-cleaning-challenge-using-Python/blob/main/data_cleaning_challenge.ipynb) to follow my cleaning process.

3. **Review Documentation:**
   - Additional insights, assumptions, and a detailed explanation of the cleaning process will be added here in the future.
